User Scenarios

1:
GB recently moved to Canada and has been using Phonetics to help him learn English more quickly. One area he has been struggling with is differentiating between the "r" and "l" sounds. He decides he will use Phonetics' listening mode to help him practice. GB opens the Phonetics app and selects his profile. From the home screen he chooses the "Listening Skills Training" module, and the "R vs L" lesson. The app presents him with a choice of two words: "rock" and "lock" and a play button. When GB presses the play button Phonetics plays a recording of one of the two words. Based on what GB thinks he heard he chooses "rock". Immediately the app responds that this was the correct response. GB repeats this process for another 14 pairs of words before his practice session ends when he reaches the end of the lesson. When his session ends Phonetics informs GB that he was 70% accurate for his session, then updates his lifetime average to 64%. Finally it shows him that he has added 10 min towards his weekly practice goal of 100 min. GB closes the app with a sense of satisfaction that he is improving.

Cindy has been using Phonetics for the past year and is interested in seeing how she has improved since she started. She opens Phonetics and selects her profile. From the home screen Cindy selects the statistics button on her English Listening module. This brings up her statistics since she started using Phonetics. She can see that her overall listening accuracy for English 92%. Cindy taps on the listening accuracy statistic and Phonetics shows her a graph of her progress over the year as well as the time she spent in Phonetics practicing. Cindy is happy to see that as she increased the amount of time she used Phonetics the more accurate her scores became. She navigates back to the home screen and selects the her English speaking statistic, this time Phonetics tells her that she is only 67% accurate. She taps on the accuracy statistic to bring up the detailed view. Once again Phonetics shows her a graph of her progress over the year and her time spent practicing in Phonetics. Cindy notices that at first her accuracy increased but then plateaued. She also notices that her practice time has flat-lined since she began using Phonetics. Cindy decides it is time she starts practicing speaking English more often. She selects the menu button in the top right and selects the goal option. From here she presses the plus button in the top right to add a new goal. She selects "New Weekly Goal" from the options, then selects "Increasing Time Goal", selects the "English Speaking" module, and finally sets the initial time goal to be 60 min. Phonetics confirms that her new goal has been created. Cindy returns to the home menu and selects "Speaking: Challenge Words" to begin working towards her new goal by practicing the the words she has had the most trouble with in the past. As she continues practicing and improving, her list of challenge words decreases until she has mastered them all.
